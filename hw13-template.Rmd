For Problems 1-3, let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be a random sample from a Poisson$(\lambda)$ distribution.

#### Problem 1 (9.7)

Find the likelihood ratio for testing $H_0: \lambda = \lambda_0$ vs $H_A: \lambda = \lambda_1$ where $\lambda_1 > \lambda_0$.

#### Problem 2 (9.7)

Use the fact that the sum of independent Poisson RVs follows a Poisson distribution to explain how to determine a rejection region for a test at level $\alpha$. 




\pagebreak

#### Problem 3 (9.8)

Show that the test in the previous problems is uniformly most powerful for testing $H_0: \lambda = \lambda_0$ vs $H_A: \lambda > \lambda_0$.
