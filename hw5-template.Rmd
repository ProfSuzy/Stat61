#### Problem 1 (8.4)

Suppose $X$ is a discrete RV with mass function
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(X=0) &=& \frac{2}{3}\theta \\
P(X=1) &=& \frac{1}{3}\theta \\
P(X=2) &=& \frac{2}{3}(1-\theta) \\
P(X=3) &=& \frac{1}{3}(1-\theta),
\end{eqnarray*}
where $0 \leq \theta \leq 1$. The following $10$ independent observations were taken from this distribution: $(3, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1)$.

(a) Find the likelihood for $\theta$. 

(b) Assume the prior $\theta \sim Unif[0,1]$ and find the posterior distribution for $\theta$.

#### Problem 2 (8.21)

Suppose that $X_1, \dots, X_n$ are IID with density $f(x) = e^{-(x-\theta)}\mathbbm{I}\{ x \geq \theta\}$. Find the method of moments estimate of $\theta$.

#### Problem 3 (8.21)

As in the previous problem, suppose that $X_1, \dots, X_n$ are IID with density $f(x) = e^{-(x-\theta)}\mathbbm{I}\{ x \geq \theta\}$. Suppose we observe the data $(x_1, x_2, x_3)=(1, 2, -1)$. Draw a sketch of the likelihood function and find the MLE of $\theta$.
