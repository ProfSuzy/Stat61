## Problem 1 

For $n=1040$ male college soccer players, the correlation between height and weight is about $r=0.75$. The sample means for heights and weights are about $\bar{x}=71$ in and $\bar{y}=166$ lbs, and the sample standard deviations are about $s_x=2.5$ in and $s_y = 16$ lbs.

(a) Find the least squares regression line for predicting weight from height. What proportion of the variability in weights is explained by a linear fit on height? 

In a SLR model, the estimate for the slope is $\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$ and the estimate for the intercept is $\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x}$. Recall that $s^2_x = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2$ and $r = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{s_x s_y}$. Thus $\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{s_x s_y r}{s^2_x} = \frac{s_y r}{s_x} = (0.75)(16)/2.5 = 4.8$ inches/lb and $\hat{\beta}_0 = 166 - (4.8)(71) = -174.8$ inches. 

(b) Find the fitted weight for a 66 inch player and for a 76 inch player. Explain how these fitted values illustrate the regression towards the mean effect in an answer that involves standard deviations relative to the respective means. Hint: You textbook doesn't discuss regression towards the mean but if you google this phrase, you'll find lots of examples and wiki pages on this phenomena! 

```{r}
-174.89 + 4.8*66
-174.89 + 4.8*76
```

(c) Use the sample correlation and standard deviation of the weights to find the root mean squared error for the simple regression model. Explain what this number represents in this context.

## Problem 2 

Consider the no-intercept linear regression model 
$$Y_i \mid X_i=x_i \sim N(\beta x_i, \sigma^2), \quad i=1, \dots, n.$$
We should include an intercept in the model even if we believe the mean response when $x=0$ should be 0, however working with the no-intercept model can help understand the more complicated model since here $\beta$ is a scalar rather than a vector. 

(a) Show that the least squares estimate for $\beta$ is $\hat\beta = \frac{\sum_{i}x_i Y_i}{\sum_i x_i^2} = (\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{Y}$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is the $n \times 1$ matrix (vector) of $x_i$ values and $\mathbf{Y}$ is the $n \times 1$ vector of $Y_i$ values. 



(b) Write the joint log-likelihood of $(\beta, \sigma^2)$ and explain why the MLE for $\beta$ is the same as the least squares estimate for $\beta$. 



(c) Find the mean and variance of $\hat \beta$.

## Problem 3
A simple exponential decay models says that the concentration, $C_{(t)}$ of a pesticide remaining after time $t$ is $C_{(t)} = C_0 e^{-\gamma t}$ for $t>0$ where $C_0$ is the initial concentration and $\gamma$ is a constant that determines the rate of decay. 

(a) Show how taking the natural log of both sides of the equation above results in a linear model for $Y = \log (C_{(t)})$ on $t$. What are the slope and intercept? 

$$\ln \left( C_{(t)} \right)  = \ln \left(C_0 e^{-\gamma t} \right) = ln(C_0) - \gamma t$$
is the equation for a line where the intercept is $ln(C_0)$ and the slope is $-\gamma$. 

(b) If you have data on concentrations at $n$ different times, $t_i$, you could estimate $\gamma$ by fitting a SLR of $Y_i$ on $t_i$. This implicitly assumes an additive error term $\epsilon_i$ that is approximately normally distributed. Write out the implied model for $C_{(t)}$ and describe how error enters this model.
