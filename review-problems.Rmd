#### Problem 1 (1.45)

Show that if the conditional probabilities exist, then 
$P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots \cap A_n) = P(A_1)P(A_2 \mid A_1)P(A_3 \mid A_1 \cap A_2) \cdots P(A_n \mid A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots \cap A_{n-1})$.

#### Problem 2 (2.50)

Show by change of variables that 
$$\Gamma(x) = 2\int_{0}^{\infty} t^{2x-1}e^{-t^2}dt = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{xt}e^{-e^t}dt.$$

#### Problem 3 (2.13)

A multiple-choice test consists of $20$ items, each with four choices. A student is able to eliminate one of the choices on each question as incorrect and chooses randomly from the remaining three choices. A passing grade is $12$ items or more correct. What is the probability the student passes?

#### Problem 1 (3.14)

Suppose that the joint density for $(X,Y)$ is $f(x,y) = xe^{-x(y+1)}\mathbbm{I}\{0 \leq x < \infty\}\mathbbm{I}\{0 \leq y < \infty\}$. Determine if $X$ and $Y$ are independent by calculating their marginal densities.

#### Problem 2 (3.19)
 
Suppose that two components have independent exponentially distributed lifetimes, $T_1$ and $T_2$, with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, respectively. Find $P(T_1 > T_2)$.

#### Problem 3 (3.20)

If $X_1 \sim Unif[0,1]$ and $(X_2 \mid X_1 = x_1) \sim Unif[0,x_1]$, what is the marginal distribution of $X_2$?
