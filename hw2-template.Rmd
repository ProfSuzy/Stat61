#### Problem 1 (4.24)

Suppose $X_1, \dots X_n$ are jointly distributed **discrete** RVs with expectations $E(X_i)$. Suppose $Y$ is a linear function of the $X_i$ so that $Y = a + b\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_iX_i$. Prove that
$$E(Y) = a + \sum_{i=1}^{n}b_i E(X_i).$$

#### Problem 2 (4.33)

Prove Chebyshev's inequality for discrete RVs.

#### Problem 3 (4.63)

As in HW 3 \# 1, let $X$ and $Y$ have the joint density 
$$f(x,y) = \frac{6}{7}(x+y)^2\mathbbm{I}\{ 0 \leq x \leq 1\}\mathbbm{I}\{ 0 \leq y \leq 1\}.$$

(a) Find the covariance of $X$ and $Y$. 

(b) Find $E(Y \mid X=x)$ for $x=1,2,34$. Fin d the probability mass function of the RV $E(Y \mid X)$.
