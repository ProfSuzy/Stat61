#### Problem 1 (3.14)

Suppose that the joint density for $(X,Y)$ is $f(x,y) = xe^{-x(y+1)}\mathbbm{I}\{0 \leq x < \infty\}\mathbbm{I}\{0 \leq y < \infty\}$. Determine if $X$ and $Y$ are independent by calculating their marginal densities.

#### Problem 2 (3.19)
 
Suppose that two components have independent exponentially distributed lifetimes, $T_1$ and $T_2$, with parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, respectively. Find $P(T_1 > T_2)$.

#### Problem 3 (3.20)

If $X_1 \sim Unif[0,1]$ and $(X_2 \mid X_1 = x_1) \sim Unif[0,x_1]$, what is the marginal distribution of $X_2$?
