#### Problem 1 (8.31)

Anne spins a (fair) coin three times and observes no heads. She givens the coin to Noha who decides to spin the coin until a heads occurs. Noha spins the coin a total of four times. Let $\theta$ be the probability the coin comes up heads. 

(a) What is the likelihood of $\theta$? 

(b) What is the MLE for $\theta$?

#### Problem 2 (8.52)

Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be IID RVs with density 
$$f(x ; \theta) = (\theta+1)x^{\theta} \mathbbm{I}\{0 \leq x \leq 1 \}.$$
Find the method of moments estimate of $\theta$.

#### Problem 3 (8.52)

As in the previous problem, let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be IID RVs with density 
$$f(x ; \theta) = (\theta+1)x^{\theta} \mathbbm{I}\{0 \leq x \leq 1 \}.$$
Find the maximum likelihood estimate of $\theta$.
