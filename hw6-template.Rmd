#### Problem 1 (8.31)

Anne spins a (fair) coin three times and observes no heads. She givens the coin to Noha who decides to spin the coin until a heads occurs. Noha spins the coin a total of four times. Let $\theta$ be the probability the coin comes up heads. 

(a) What is the likelihood of $\theta$? 

(b) What is the MLE for $\theta$?

#### Problem 2 (8.53)

Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be IID $Unif[0,\theta]$. 

(a) Find the method of moments estimate of $\theta$ and its mean and variance. 


(b) Find the MLE of $\theta$ and find its sampling distribution.

#### Problem 3 (8.53)

Let $X_1, \dots, X_n$ be IID $Unif[0,\theta]$. 

(a) Compare the variance, bias, and the mean squared error of the MOM estimator and the MLE from Problem 2 (above).

(b) Find a modification of the MLE that renders it unbiased.
