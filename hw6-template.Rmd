#### Problem 1 (8.31)

Anne spins a (fair) coin three times and observes no heads. She givens the coin to Noha who decides to spin the coin until a heads occurs. Noha spins the coin a total of four times. Let $\theta$ be the probability the coin comes up heads. 

(a) What is the likelihood of $\theta$? 

(b) What is the MLE for $\theta$?

#### Problem 2 (8.21)

Suppose that $X_1, \dots, X_n$ are IID with density $f(x) = e^{-(x-\theta)}\mathbbm{I}\{ x \geq \theta\}$.

(a) Find the method of moments estimate of $\theta$. 

(b) Draw a sketch of the likelihood function for observed data $(x_1, x_2, x_3)=(1, 2, -1)$.

#### Problem 3 (8.21)

As in the previous problem, suppose that $X_1, \dots, X_n$ are IID with density $f(x) = e^{-(x-\theta)}\mathbbm{I}\{ x \geq \theta\}$. Find the MLE of $\theta$.
