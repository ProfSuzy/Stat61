#### Problem X

In the group game called "waterfall", a group of $n$ people sit in a circle and draw cards from a deck. When someone draws an ace they begin drinking their beverage and, in each subsequent person in the circle begins to drink their beverage one-at-a-time. The challenge is that each individual must continue drinking until the person prior to them stops, thus forming a system of connected series. The waterfall ends (i.e. the system fails) if any one of the individuals stops drinking before the person who began drinking prior to them.

Assume Asha, Sarah, Matilda, Amy, and Koji are playing this game and that the amount of time each person can drink non-stop ($X_i$) are independent with density
$$ f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}\mathbb{I}\{x \geq 0\}.$$
Let $V=X_{(1)}$ be the random variable representing the lifetime of the waterfall for this group. 

(a) What is the distribution of $V$? 

(b) What is the likelihood of $\tau = 1/\lambda$? 

(c) What is the MLE of $\tau$?
