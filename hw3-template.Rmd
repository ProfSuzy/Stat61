#### Problem 1 (3.8)

Let $X$ and $Y$ have the joint density 
$$f(x,y) = \frac{6}{7}(x+y)^2\mathbbm{I}\{ 0 \leq x \leq 1\}\mathbbm{I}\{ 0 \leq y \leq 1\}.$$
(a) Find the marginal densities for $X$ and $Y$. 

(b) Find both conditional densities.

#### Problem 2 (4.4)

Let $X$ have the CDF $F(x) = 1 - x^{-a}\mathbbm{I}\{x \geq 1\}$. Find $E(X)$ and $Var(X)$ for the values of $a$ where they exist.

#### Problem 3 (4.16)

Suppose $E(X)=\mu$ and $Var(X) = \sigma^2$. Let $Z = (X-\mu)/\sigma$. Show that $E(Z)=1$ and $Var(Z) = 1$. 

(a) Find the covariance of $X$ and $Y$. 

(b) Find $E(Y \mid X = x)$ for $0 \leq x \leq 1$.
