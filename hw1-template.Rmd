#### Problem 1 (1.45)

Show that if the conditional probabilities exist, then 
$P(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots \cap A_n) = P(A_1)P(A_2 \mid A_1)P(A_3 \mid A_1 \cap A_2) \cdots P(A_n \mid A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots \cap A_{n-1})$.

#### Problem 2 (2.50)

Show by change of variables that 
$$\Gamma(x) = 2\int_{0}^{\infty} t^{2x-1}e^{-t^2}dt = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{xt}e^{-e^t}dt.$$

#### Problem 3 (2.13)

A multiple-choice test consists of $20$ items, each with four choices. A student is able to eliminate one of the choices on each question as incorrect and chooses randomly from the remaining three choices. A passing grade is $12$ items or more correct.
