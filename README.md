# Grade components 

* Daily homework - Worth 20% of overall course grade 
You will be assigned daily homework problems sets consisting of four problems each. These homework sets will be submitted to Gradescope. Half of the questions will be graded for completion, half for correctness. This will be determined randomly for each problem set. Some homeworks (but not all) will require the use of software. Written or typed homework solutions are both acceptable. Your overall homework grade will be either the mean or median of your individual scores (whichever is highest). Homework is due (to Gradescope) by the beginning of our next class period however, each student is permitted a late pass to use three times during the semester. 

* Semesterly participation - Worth 10% of overall course grade 
More information on this part of your grade will be given in class.  

* 5 Quizzes - Each worth 10% of overall course grade 
These quizzes reinforce the previous lessons and homework assignments as well as prepare you for the material lying ahead. You will have the entire 50 minute class period to complete each quiz and all problems will be graded for correctness. I will try to have your grades posted to Gradescope within one week of the quiz date. You will be permitted a one-sided sheet of notes for each quiz and the use of a non-graphing calculator. Otherwise, the quizzes are closed book. 

* Final test - Worth 20% of overall course grade
The final test will be cumulative and you will be permitted use of a single double-sided sheet of personal notes.
