# Course Description

Introduction to the mathematical theory of frequentist and Bayesian statistical inference. Topics include parameter estimation, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, linear regression methods and some basic Bayesian methods. This course will assume you are familiar with STAT 011 topics and have some prior experience with computing. The textbook we will use in class is Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis, 3rd edition, by John A Rice. You are expected to read along in your textbook each week according to the calendar above. The class format will begin in a traditional lecture-heavy manner (for Unit 1) but will transition gradually to include more active learning sessions than lectures towards the end of the semester (by Unit 3). 

## Prerequisite: 
A grade of C or better in both STAT 051 and MATH 027 (or 028); or permission of the instructor.  

## Expected knowledge from prior statistical education that will be reinforced in the beginning of the semester 

* Demonstrate proficiency with the theory of probability and concept of random variables; familiarity with common distributions and transformations; ability to analytically derive moments of common distributions; understanding of central limit theorem as a theory and in practice. 

* Familiarity with sampling considerations and principles of experimental design; ability to plan and execute informative descriptions to accurately summarize data including graphical methods. 

* Proficiency with some sort of statistical analysis software.

# Learning objectives for Stat 61

1. Understand frequentist and Bayesian methods for parameter estimation and common approaches to evaluate and compare estimators.  

2. Work with asymptotic theorems to characterize the behavior of common types of estimators. 

3. Understand how to analytically derive a Bayesian posterior distribution and how to interpret a Bayesian credible interval and demonstrate familiarity with different types of priors.  

4. Understand the important role of likelihood functions for hypothesis testing in both Bayesian and frequentist frameworks 

5. Understand the relationship between frequentist confidence interval estimation and hypothesis testing.  

6. Familiarity with common types of optimal testing strategies.

7. Construct and interpret frequentist p-values for hypothesis tests and interpret the error rates. 

8. Identify/define model parameters and state statistical inferential questions in terms of these parameters for various common, realistic study settings.   

9. Contextualize statistical methods and theory in science and policy at large and develop a habit of mind informed by the stewardly application of such methods. 

# Grade components 

* Daily homework - Worth 20% of overall course grade 
You will be assigned daily homework problems sets consisting of four problems each. These homework sets will be submitted to Gradescope. Half of the questions will be graded for completion, half for correctness. This will be determined randomly for each problem set. Some homeworks (but not all) will require the use of software. Written or typed homework solutions are both acceptable. Your overall homework grade will be either the mean or median of your individual scores (whichever is highest). Homework is due (to Gradescope) by the beginning of our next class period however, each student is permitted a late pass to use twice during the semester. You are encouraged to work with your classmates on your homework but you are expected to hand in your own unique solutio. Assignments with any answers that appear to be copied versions of another's  will receive a grade of zero for all matching submissions.

* Semesterly participation - Worth 10% of overall course grade 
More information on this portion of your grade will be given in class.

* 5 Quizzes - Each worth 10% of overall course grade 
These quizzes reinforce the previous lessons and homework assignments as well as prepare you for the material lying ahead. You will have 25 minutes in class to begin working on each quiz and you can take it home with you to complete by the end of the day. Your solutions must be uploaded to Gradescope by midnight that evening. You are not allowed to seek external help from anyone on your quizzes but you may reference your textbook and class notes on your own. All problems will be graded for correctness and I will try to have your grades posted to Gradescope within one week.

* Final test - Worth 20% of overall course grade
The final test will be cumulative and closed-book but you will be permitted use of a single double-sided sheet of personal notes. The final will occur during finals week sometime between Dec 7-11 and no make ups will be given.  

## Quiz and test policies
During quizzes and tests, you are welcome to use the restroom facilities as you need but I ask that you take turns so only one person is gone from the classroom at a time. I also request all students to put their phones on their desk upside down and leave them there when using the facilities. 

Make-up quizzes and tests will not be given unless you have notified me at least three weeks in advance of the date or in case of an extreme, urgent emergency. 

Finally, although there is built-in flexibility with the due dates of homework assignments, I strongly recommend that you keep up with the homework and reading assignments each week. This will provide you with a framework to better follow along with material in class and will better prepare you for the quizzes and final test. 

## Office hours etiquette
I encourage you to attend office hours as often as possible! If you are unable to attend my regular office hours then please send me an email so we can arrange another time to meet. Please note that I can only make these accommodations for academic scheduling conflicts. 

I want to make sure that everyone who shows up gets a chance to ask a question. I prioritize student questions usually by whoever arrives first but sometimes will poll students and prioritize questions that more than one student has in common.

When it’s your turn to ask a question, please limit yourself to only one question (even if it is a question with a very short answer). Once everyone present has gotten a chance to ask their question, you will get the opportunity to ask another question. 
When others are asking questions, pay attention because you might learn something from the discussion. In fact, when the same question keeps getting repeated in office hours, I turn to students who asked the question before to answer the question when it arises again. 

# Study guide 

## Unit One - Thoughtful use of estimation techniques

* Chapters 1-3 
**Sections covered**: All 

**Learning objectives**: Expected knowledge from prior statistical education that will be reinforced in the beginning of the semester 

**Notes**: This material covers topics that are heavily explored in the prereq Stat 51. We will not spend any time in class going over these topics. You may want to review the table of contents and bolded terms and main theorems of these chapters as a refresher. 

* Chapter 4
**Sections covered**: 4.1 - 4.5  

**Learning objectives**: Expected knowledge from prior statistical education that will be reinforced in the beginning of the semester 

**Notes**: We will spend a little bit of class time reviewing some of the parts of this chapter with a particular emphasis on material that will be useful when we get to Ch 8. The material for this unit will be presented mainly in traditional lecture format but we will start to have regular time in class for group work and problem solving now. 

* Chapters 5-6 
**Sections covered**: All 

**Learning objectives**: Expected knowledge from prior statistical education that will be reinforced in the beginning of the semester; 2) Work with asymptotic theorems to characterize the behavior of common types of estimators.  

**Notes**: These are very short chapters but they are still important. In class we will emphasize material from Ch 5 on the Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem but you are expected to be familiar with all of the material in these chapters. We will start to work with a particular analytical tool called a "stakeholder analysis" to delve into these topics. 

* Chapter 8 
**Sections covered**:  All 

**Learning objectives**: 1) Understand frequentist and Bayesian methods for parameter estimation and common approaches to evaluate and compare estimators; 2) Work with asymptotic theorems to characterize the behavior of common types of estimators; 3) Understand how to analytically derive a Bayesian posterior distribution and how to interpret a Bayesian credible interval and demonstrate familiarity with different types of priors.  

**Notes**: We are covering this chapter in a different order than the sections are presented in your textbook so please follow the course calendar. We will continue to use a stakeholder analysis to help reach the learning objectives. 

## Unit Two - Statistical inference and stewardship 

* Chapter 9 
**Sections covered**:  9.1 - 9.5, 9.10 

**Learning objectives**: 4) Understand the important role of likelihood functions for hypothesis testing in both Bayesian and frequentist frameworks; 5) Understand the relationship between frequentist confidence interval estimation and hypothesis testing; 6) Familiarity with common types of optimal testing strategies; 7) Construct and interpret frequentist p-values for hypothesis tests and interpret the error rates. 

**Notes**: We are going to spend at least a third of the semester on this chapter alone. Even though we won't cover every single section of the chapter, the material here is deep and is very important for any statistical practitioner to understand. Here you will start to understand what it means to be a steward of statistics and why that is important. 

## Unit Three - Disciplinary best practices for common study designs and analyses 

* Chapter 11 
**Sections covered**:  11.1 - 11.2, 11.4 - 11.5 

**Learning objectives**: 8) Identify/define model parameters and state statistical inferential questions in terms of these parameters for various common, realistic study settings; 9) Contextualize statistical methods and theory in science and policy at large and develop a habit of mind informed by the stewardly application of such methods.

**Notes**: This is the first chapter where we get into more specific (but generally applicable) statistical tests and methods. We will introduce the American Statistical Association's Guidelines for Ethical Practice here as we cover ways to compare two samples. 

* Chapter 12 
**Sections covered**: All 

**Learning objectives**: 8) Identify/define model parameters and state statistical inferential questions in terms of these parameters for various common, realistic study settings; 9) Contextualize statistical methods and theory in science and policy at large and develop a habit of mind informed by the stewardly application of such methods.

**Notes**: We will continue to reference the ASA's ethical guidelines with respect to ANOVA methods. At this point in the semester, there will be less material covered in lecture-format and more time in class working through problems together.  

* Chapter 13 
**Sections covered**:  13.1 - 13.4

**Learning objectives**: 8) Identify/define model parameters and state statistical inferential questions in terms of these parameters for various common, realistic study settings; 9) Contextualize statistical methods and theory in science and policy at large and develop a habit of mind informed by the stewardly application of such methods.

**Notes**: We will continue to reference the ASA's ethical guidelines with respect to the analysis of categorical data. Most class time will be collaborative problem solving rather than lectures.

* Chapter 14 
**Sections covered**:  14.1 - 14.4; 14.8 

**Learning objectives**: 8) Identify/define model parameters and state statistical inferential questions in terms of these parameters for various common, realistic study settings; 9) Contextualize statistical methods and theory in science and policy at large and develop a habit of mind informed by the stewardly application of such methods.

**Notes**: We will continue to reference the ASA's ethical guidelines with respect to linear regression. Most class time will be collaborative problem solving rather than lectures.
