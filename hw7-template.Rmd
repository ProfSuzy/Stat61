#### Problem 1 (8.19)

Suppose $X_1, \dots, X_n$ are IID $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. 

(a) If $\sigma$ is known, what is the MLE of $\mu$? 

(b) If $\sigma$ is known, is there any other unbiased estimate of $\mu$ with a smaller variance than the estimate in (a)? Why/why not?

#### Problem 2 (8.33)

Suppose $X_1, \dots, X_n$ are IID $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ where both $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are unknown. How should the constant $c$ be chosen so that the interval $(-\infty, \bar{X}+ c)$ is a $95\%$ CI for $\mu$? (I.e. $c$ should be chosen so that $Pr(-\infty < \mu \leq \bar{X} + c)$.)

#### Problem 3 (8.75)

Show that the gamma distribution belongs to the exponential family.
