#### Problem 3 (12.10)


Suppose that in a one-way layout there are ten treatments and seven observations under each treatment. Consider simultaneous confidence intervals for the difference of two means using (a)Tukey's method, (b)Bonferroni's method, (c)no multiple comparison adjustments. Put these three methods (a,b,c) in order from those that produce the largest intervals to those that produce the narrowest intervals. Explain your ordering.
